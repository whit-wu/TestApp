# TestApp

A test project to help explain how Angular's files work together to generate a user experience.  Explanation can be found on [Youtube]() and [my website]().

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.  To have a browser window open automatically, run `ng serve -o`.
